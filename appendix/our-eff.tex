\item[Signature Size:] The number of elements of $\GG_1$ required  for the signature is
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 for committing to the Boneh-Boyen signature,
\item 4 for the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item 4 for commitment to $[\vecb{x}]_1$,
\item $18\sqrt[3]{n} + 12$ for membership in $H$ and $G$,
\item $4\sqrt[3]{n}$ for commitments to $A'$.
\item $8\sqrt[3]{n}$ for proof  $\pi_{Q_m}$,
\item $2$ for proof $\pi_h$,
\item $8$ for $\pi_g$,
\end{itemize}
which adds up to $30\sqrt[3]{n} + 32$.

The number of elements of $\GG_2$ required  for the signature is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 for committing to the Boneh-Boyen verification key,
\item 4 for the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item 4 for commitment to $[\vecb{y}]_2$,
\item $18\sqrt[3]{n} + 8$ for membership in $H$ and $G$,
\item $2\sqrt[3]{n}-2$ for commitments to $[\vecb{\kappa}']_2$.
\item $8\sqrt[3]{n}$ for proof  $\pi_{Q_m}$,
\item $8$ for $\pi_g$,
\end{itemize}
which adds up to $28\sqrt[3]{n} + 28$. Additionally, it requires $\sqrt[3]{n}$ elements of $\Z_q$.
\item[Signature Time:] The number of exponentiations computed by the prover is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 for the Boneh-Boyen signature
\item 8 for computing $[\vecb{c}]_2$ and $[\vecb{d}]_1$,
\item 8 for proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $16$ for commitments to $[\vecb{x}]_1$ and $[\vecb{y}]_2$,
\item $53\sqrt[3]{n}$ for membership in $G$ and $H$,
\item $12\sqrt[3]{n}-4$ for commitments to $A'$ and $[\vecb{\kappa}']_2$,
\item $16\sqrt[3]{n}$ for proof $\pi_{Q_m}$,
\item $2$ for proof $\pi_{Q_h}$,
\item $16$,
\end{itemize}
which ads up to $80\sqrt[3]{n}+71$.
\item[Verification Time:] The number of paring operations for verifying a signature is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 24 for verifying the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $8n^{2/3} + 96\sqrt[3]{n} + 56$ for membership in $H$ and $G$,
\item $46\sqrt[3]{n}$ for proof $\pi_{Q_m}$,
\item $4\sqrt[3]{n}+8$ for proof $\pi_h$,
\item $16\sqrt[3]{n}+36$ for proof $\pi_g$,
\end{itemize}
which ads up to $8n^{2/3} + 162\sqrt[3]{n} + 118$.
