\item[Signature Size:] The number of elements of $\GG_1$ required  for the signature is
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 for committing to the Boneh-Boyen signature,
\item 4 for the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $4\sqrt{n}$ for commitments to $b_1,\ldots,b_m,b'_1,\ldots,b_m$,
\item $8\sqrt{n}$ for proof i,
\item $4$ for proof iv,
\end{itemize}
which adds up to $12\sqrt{n}+10$.

The number of elements of $\GG_2$ required  for the signature is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 for committing to the Boneh-Boyen verification key,
\item 4 for the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $4\sqrt{n}$ for commitments to $b_1,\ldots,b_m,b'_1,\ldots,b_m$,
\item $2\sqrt{n}$ for commitments to $[\kappa_1]_2,\ldots,[\kappa_m]_2$,
\item $8\sqrt{n}$ for proof i,
\item $\sqrt{n}$ for proof iii,
\item $2$ elements for proof iv,
\end{itemize}
which ads up to $15\sqrt{n}+8$. Additionally, it requires $\sqrt{n}$ elements of $\Z_q$.
\item[Signature Time:] The number of exponentiations computed by the prover is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 for the Boneh-Boyen signature
\item 8 for computing $[\vecb{c}]_2$ and $[\vecb{d}]_1$,
\item 8 for proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $16\sqrt{n}$ for commitments to $b_1,\ldots,b_m,b'_1,\ldots,b_m$,
\item $4\sqrt{n}$ for commitments to $[\kappa_1]_2,\ldots,[\kappa_m]_2$,
\item $16\sqrt{n}$ for proof i,
\item $\sqrt{n}$ for proof iii,
\item $6$ for proof iii,
\end{itemize}
which ads up to $37\sqrt{n}+23$ exponentiations.
\item[Verification Time:] The number of paring operations for verifying a signature is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 24 for verifying the proof that the Boneh-Boyen signature is correct,
\item $48\sqrt{n}$ for proof i,
\item $2n+4\sqrt{n}$ for proof iii,
\item $8\sqrt{n} + 14$ fro proof iv,
\end{itemize}
which ads up to $2n + 60\sqrt{n}+38$ exponentiations.
