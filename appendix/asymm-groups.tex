Let $\ggen_a$ be some probabilistic polynomial time algorithm which on input $1^{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, returns the \emph{group key} which is the description of an asymmetric bilinear group $gk:=(q,\GG_1,\GG_2,\GG_T,e,\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2)$, where $\GG_1,\GG_2$
and $\GG_T$ are groups of prime order $q$, the elements $\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2$ are generators of 
$\GG_1,\GG_2$ respectively, and $e:\GG_1\times\GG_2\to\GG_T$ is an efficiently
computable, non-degenerate bilinear map. 

Elements in $\GG_s$, are denoted implicitly as $[a]_s:=a \Pt_s$, where $s \in \{1,2,T\}$ and $\Pt_T:=e(\Pt_1,\Pt_2)$. 
The pairing operation will be written as a product $\cdot$, that is $[a]_1 \cdot [b]_2=[a]_1 [b]_2=e([a]_1,[b]_2)=[ab]_T$. Vectors and matrices are denoted in boldface. Given a matrix $\matr{T}=(t_{i,j})$, $[\matr{T}]_s$ is
the natural embedding of $\matr{T}$ in $\GG_s$, that is, the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry
is $t_{i,j}\mathcal{P}_s$. We denote by $|\GG_s|$ the bit-size of the elements of $\GG_s$.
