We recall the definition of a hash function and also a weaker notion from the work of Rogaway and Shrimption \cite{FSE:RogShr04}. For both defintions we consider functions Let $g,h:\mathcal{K}\times\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{Y}$ and $\KGen$ an algorithm which on input $1^\lambda$ randomly samples an element from $\mathcal{K}$

\begin{definition}[Collision Resistance]\label{def:hash1}
 We say that $g$ is a hash-function family with collision resistance if for all PPT adversary $\advA$
$$
\adv_g^{\mathsf{Col}}(\advA) := \Pr[k\gets\KGen(1^\lambda), (x,x')\gets A(k):g_k(x)=g_k(x')]
$$ 
is negligible in $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Always Second-Preimage Resistance \cite{FSE:RogShr04}]\label{def:hash2}
 We say that $h$ is a hash-function family with always second-preimage resistance if for all PPT adversary $\advA$
$$
\adv_h^{\mathsf{Col}}(\advA) := \Pr[k\gets\KGen(1^\lambda), x\gets\mathcal{M}, x'\gets A(k):h_k(x)=h_k(x')]
$$ 
is negligible in $\lambda$.
\end{definition}
